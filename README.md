CPSC 349 Web Front End Engineering Group Project One: Full Stack Website

## About the Project
Get To Know Me is a website where you could sum up what you're up to by sharing your profile to others in a very simple way. Users can share a picture, name, their social networks, and a bio. Get To Know Me was created with simplicity in mind and we intentionally limit the customization options to keep it simple and useable. Whether you're looking to share a simple business card or a biography about you and your work, Get To Know Me aims to help you spread the word with style.
Get To Know Me was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google’s Firebase to store user data.
