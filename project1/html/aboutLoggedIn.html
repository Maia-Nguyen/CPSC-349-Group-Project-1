                Our mission is simple, we created a page where you could sum up what you're 
                up to. You can link your work to your platforms in a very simple way. Get 
                your own unique link and share it with the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                Get to know me was created with simplicity in mind. We intentionally limit
                the customization options to keep it simple and nice. 
                <br>
                <br>
                You are able to chanage your infomation with the navigation controls listed
                on your account. You can change it as many times as you want, as long as the
                link you created has not been taken. Also, keep in mind that whenever you 
                change your personal link, people who had the previous one might not be able 
                to reach your profile anymore.
